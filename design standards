## Purpose
Help any agent review UI work (specs, code, screenshots) against our Design Standards and generate actionable feedback.

## Inputs (ask if missing)
- Artifact type: code | spec | screenshot | PR diff | component API
- Platform: web | iOS | Android
- Component(s) and states: default/hover/pressed/disabled/error/loading
- Constraints: existing tokens, legacy CSS, deadlines

## Sources of truth (required)
- references/standards.md
- references/tokens.json (if present)
- assets/report-template.md

## Procedure
1) Identify the UI surface (component/page), platform, states, and context.
2) Extract implemented decisions:
   - tokens (color/type/spacing), sizes, layout rules, component anatomy, state behavior
3) Compare against standards and record:
   - PASS items
   - FAIL items (cite standard section or ID)
4) Provide remediations:
   - specific token names
   - specific spacing/type scale values
   - component API adjustments
   - code snippets where appropriate
5) If unknowns exist, list assumptions and request missing info.

# Lego Design System — Skills Agent

## Purpose
This file defines how an AI assistant should design screens using the **Lego Design System**.
It provides standard guidance for layout, styling, content, and accessibility to ensure
consistent, usable, and accessible UI output.

This is a lightweight skills definition intended for testing and iteration.

## Skill: Design Screens with the Lego Design System

### Skill ID
lego.design.screens

### When to Use This Skill
Use this skill whenever:
- Designing a new screen, flow, or UI surface
- Converting requirements into UI layouts
- Generating wireframes or high-fidelity designs
- Evaluating design consistency against the Lego Design System

---

## Design Principles

- **Clarity first**: Prioritize readability, hierarchy, and clear user intent
- **Consistency over novelty**: Prefer existing patterns and components
- **Accessible by default**: Every screen must meet accessibility standards
- **Composable layouts**: Build screens from reusable Lego components
- **Content-aware design**: UI adapts to real content, not placeholder assumptions

---

## Layout Standards

- Use a **single primary column** for most screens
- Prefer **8px spacing increments** for margins and padding
- Maintain clear vertical rhythm between sections
- Avoid full-width content unless explicitly required
- Group related elements using spacing, not borders

### Common Layout Patterns
- Header → Content → Actions
- List → Detail
- Form → Review → Confirmation

---

## Component Usage Rules

- Always use Lego system components when available
- Do not restyle components outside approved variants
- Combine components through composition, not customization
- Avoid introducing new UI patterns unless necessary

### Buttons
- One primary action per screen
- Secondary actions should be visually subordinate
- Destructive actions must be clearly labeled

### Forms
- One input per row
- Labels must always be visible
- Inline validation preferred over blocking errors

---

## Styling Guidelines

### Color
- Use design token names, not raw hex values
- Primary color reserved for primary actions only
- Avoid color-only meaning (must pair with text or icon)

### Typography
- Use system-defined text styles
- Maintain clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H3)
- Body text should never be smaller than the system minimum

### Iconography
- Icons support text; they do not replace it
- Use consistent icon sizes across similar actions

---

## Content Standards

### Voice & Tone
- Clear, human, and neutral
- Avoid jargon unless required by context
- Prefer short sentences and active voice

### Labels & Copy
- Buttons use verbs (e.g., “Save”, “Continue”)
- Error messages explain the issue and the fix
- Avoid placeholder-only instructions

### Empty States
- Explain what’s missing
- Suggest a clear next action
- Avoid blaming the user

---

## Accessibility Standards

All designs must meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.

### Required Practices
- Color contrast meets minimum ratios
- All inputs have associated labels
- Focus order follows visual order
- Interactive elements have visible focus states
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements

### Screen Reader Considerations
- Use semantic structure (headings, lists)
- Avoid conveying meaning through visual styling alone
- Ensure error messages are programmatically associated

---

## Output Expectations

When using this skill, the AI assistant should:
- Describe layout and component structure clearly
- Reference Lego components by name
- Call out accessibility considerations explicitly
- Avoid introducing unsupported patterns
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
